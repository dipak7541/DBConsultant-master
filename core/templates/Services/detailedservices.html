        <h1>Geo-Technical Investigation</h1>
        <p>Geotechnical investigations are performed by geotechnical engineers or engineering
            geologists to obtain information on the physical properties of soil
            earthworks and foundations for proposed structures and for repair of
            distress to earthworks and structures caused by subsurface conditions.
            This type of investigation is called a site investigation. Additionally,
            geotechnical iLegalitiesnvestigations are also used to measure the thermal resistivity
            of soils or backfill materials required for underground transmission lines, oil
            and gas pipelines, radioactive waste disposal, and solar thermal storage facilities.
            A geotechnical investigation will include surface exploration and subsurface e
            xploration of a site. Sometimes, geophysical methods are used to obtain data about sites</p>

        <h1>Road Design</h1>
        <p>The geometric design of roads is the branch of highway engineering concerned with
            the positioning of the physical elements of the roadway according to standards
            and constraints. The basic objectives in geometric design are to optimize
            efficiency and safety while minimizing cost and environmental damage. Geometric
            design also affects an emerging fifth objective called "livability," which is
            defined as designing roads to foster broader community goals, including providing
            access to employment, schools, businesses and residences, accommodate a range of
            travel modes such as walking, bicycling, transit, and automobiles, and minimizing
            fuel use, emissions and environmental damage.</p>

        <h1>Building Design</h1>
        <p>Building design refers to the broadly based architectural, engineering and technical
            applications to the design of buildings. All building projects require the services
            of a building designer, typically a licensed architect. Smaller, less complicated
            projects often do not require a licensed professional, and the design of such projects
            is often undertaken by building designers, draftspersons, interior designers (for
            interior fit-outs or renovations), or contractors. Larger, more complex building
            projects require the services of many professionals trained in specialist
            disciplines, usually coordinated by an architect.</p>

        <h1>Structure Analysis</h1>
        <p>It is a method or tool by which we find out how a structure or a member of a
            structure behaves when subjected to certain excitation. In other words, we
            mainly focus on finding out internal forces (axial force, shear force, moment),
            stress, strain, deflection etc in a structure under applied load conditions.
            Frames can be analyzed by various methods. However, the method of analysis
            adopted depends upon the types of frame, its configuration.</p>

        <h1>Estimation and Costing</h1>
        <p>Estimation and costing in Civil deals with calculating the quantities and its
            expected expenditure to be incurred from particular project. For estimation
            and costing, followings are required:
                1. Final plan or drawings of the project. (DRAWING)
                2. Exact details about workmanship and materials to be used in project. (SPECIFICATION)
                3. Standard schedule of rates for the present Year. (RATES)

             Why do we need Costing and estimation?
            1. It helps us to decide whether rate of proposed project match meets our funds
            available for the project
            2. Avoids unwanted loss incurred in project
            3. Helps in inviting tender and quotation to arrange contract
            4. Gives an idea about time and its schedule of work required for completion of project.</p>
